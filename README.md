# Praat tmLanguage configs

A small repository containing a tmLanguage file for the [Praat](https://github.com/praat/praat) scripting language.

It is a redistribution of the praat.tmGrammar.json file from orhunulusahin's [praatvscode](https://github.com/orhunulusahin/praatvscode) plugin, which is also distributed under MIT, with minor additions and improvements
